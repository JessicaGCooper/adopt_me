A fun short project building a React.js web application for pet adoption that uses the petfinder API through a FrontEnd Masters app.

In this application we use both class and functional components and learn how to manage state with contextAPI in both types of component.

We also built a custom hook and learned a fascinating way to add any component to the application through portals.

Also covered: using Parcel (instead of Webpack), formatting Eslint, formatting prettier, adding some Babel presets and using Reach Router.
